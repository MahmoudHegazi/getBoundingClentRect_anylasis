<div>This library makes infomation processing involving various excel files as easy as processing array and dictionary. The information processing job includes when processing file upload/download, data import into and export from SQL databases, information analysis and persistence. It uses pyexcel and its plugins: 1) to provide one uniform programming interface to handle csv, tsv, xls, xlsx, xlsm and ods formats. 2) to provide one-stop utility to import the data in uploaded file into a database and to export tables in a database as excel files for file download 3) to provide the same interface for information persistence at server side: saving a uploaded excel file to and loading a saved excel file from file system.<br>
